# 3d_submarine_simulation_OpenGL

This was part of my assingment in Graphics 2. Is a submarine simulation, the keys are A,W,S,D, the arrow keys move the camera, and 
there are 3 other camera views with 2,3 and 4 keys.

The Models are not included in the repository and it will not load them, if you do not want them comment out the render and load 
of them from the display() and init() functions.


If you want to load them, you can download them and place them in the root dir inside a "Model" folder(if does not exists, create it).

The models are not mine, I found them online and all the rights are deserved my them.
